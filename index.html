		Getting to know Kevin 101
		</h1>
		
		<div>
			<p> 
			Kevin was born and raised in South Korea; he came to Canada with his family at the age of 12. It was hard at first being 
			accepted into a different culture but with time, slowly but surely, he adapted.
			</p>
			High school years were disastrous. Kevin felt as if no one understood him and disliked most teachers. He only had his group of friends
			to depend on. Even to this day, Kevin doesn’t find teachers very favorable except for his current BCIT instructors, such as Henry. But 
			then again, his twin sister is an elementary school teacher. Life sure is complicated and a mess for this guy.
			<p>
			Kevin received his bachelor’s degree in Psychology at UBC. 2 months after graduation, he started working for one of the most hated
			corporations in British Columbia, ICBC. Truly ironic since he was complaining of pricey insurance rates even to hour he walked in for
			his interview. What is more ironic is that he was involved into a motor vehicle accident coming back home after the interview, just
			after his interview for the claims adjuster position. 
			</p>
			Working full time, Kevin was able to improve in many aspects of life and a lot of questions started to come into his mind. Where is 
			this path leading to? One may say Kevin is just going through his quarter life crisis and nothing more. Kevin felt he needed a
			drastic change, something that he had never even thought of. Kevin started to look around and spoke to many people in different
			industries. Kevin came across a dear friend of his that currently works in the IT department of Canada Revenue Agency. Everything
			about the friend’s job seemed interesting to Kevin. Without hesitation, he quit his work, applied and got accepted to BCIT’s CIT
			program, went and bought a laptop, and now he’s sitting in a crowded room with 25 people. Will he succeed? Time will tell and let’s 
			hope he doesn’t starve.

			Kevin's somewhat uninteresting life can be summed up in three photos.

			First ever full time work but too bad it's hated by most British Columbians
